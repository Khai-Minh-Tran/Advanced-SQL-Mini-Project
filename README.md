# Advanced-SQL-Mini-Project


Welcome to my eCommerce data project with SQL!


I used a dataset of Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online toy retailer that just launched many of their first products. 
The dataset is available to download from the large data collection from Maven Analytics.


I imported the data to MySQL Workbench, and used SQL to extract and generate important insights for this business.
